# ðŸ§© Product & Order Service

A simple microservice-style project built with:
- Node.js Product Service (Express.js)
- PHP Order Service (plain PHP + Guzzle)

The Product Service provides product information.
The Order Service creates and stores orders by fetching product data from the Product Service.
